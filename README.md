# sb--parcel-boiler - A Parcel-based boilerplate for future Sitback builds

## Getting started

This project is built using Yarn2, which negates the need for a *node_modules* folder. The contents of the *node_modules* from previous versions of yarn/npm are stored in a compressed, normalized folder, and can be checked in to your project so that you don't need to run `yarn install` on the remote server.
